                    <h2 class="blog-post-title">Introduction</h2>

                    <p>Based on prior studies, approximately 30% of healthcare spending in the United States 
                        may be considered waste [1]. Those findings open the door to the idea that reducing healthcare 
                        waste may result in also reducing healthcare costs for consumers. From the 6 domains of waste 
                        that were identified by The Institute of Medicine, Berwick and Hackbarth [2], we used 
                        administrative complexity as the focal point of our analysis since it’s the most tangible and 
                        concrete to analyze. We defined administrative complexity as the cost of the administration and 
                        the operation of a hospital on a day-to-day basis. Using administrative costs, we will calculate an 
                        efficiency score for each hospital which we will use to get a deeper understanding of each 
                        hospital’s efficiency standing.                      
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Efficiency calculation can be very complex due to the noise in the data, and many 
                        external factors. For example, natural disasters can increase or decrease the utilization rate of a 
                        hospital, a country's economic hardship or recession can decrease the utilization rate while a 
                        pandemic can have both the effect of increasing and decreasing hospital utilization. While 
                        hospital utilization is not the only factor that drives the healthcare cost, the administrative cost 
                        will fluctuate as hospital utilization increases or decreases. The more patients that are admitted, 
                        the more the hospital spends on patient record keeping, cafeteria, laundry, and staff, just to name 
                        a few administration expenses. 
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Due to the complexity of calculating the efficiency of the hospitals, we will be using Data 
                        Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to model the efficiency 
                        score of the hospitals. DEA is a non-parametric method while SFA is a parametric method. 
                        Parametric statistics are based on assumptions about the distribution of the population from 
                        which the sample was taken while nonparametric statistics are not based on assumptions, that is, 
                        the data can be collected from a sample that does not follow a specific distribution. Cost efficiency 
                        was examined by Linna [54] who realized that the results generated by SFA and DEA are similar. 
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>According to Haney and Pollitt [94], while both methods generate similar results, they 
                        balance each other as SFA handles data noise which DEA is not able to, in fact, none of the 
                        methods are superior, in real word application, it is regarded as "best-practice" to combine the estimates 
                        obtained from DEA and SFA. Their combined efficiency score is said to be a precise efficiency score.
                        We used the mean method [92] to combine the efficiency score from DEA and the efficiency 
                        score from SFA. Hence using both DEA and SFA methods the hospital's efficiency scale that we 
                        calculate is sure to be more reliable and less susceptible to external factors bias.

                <div id="approach" class="blog-post">
                    <h2 class="blog-post-title">DATA AND APPROACH</h2>

                    <p>In this paper, we used data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
                        Hospital. More precisely the form 2552-10 WORKSHEET B-1, which is the hospital cost report. 
                        The data is from 2010 to 2021 and comes from 6802 distinct hospitals for a total of 63,435 rows. 
                        We dropped data from 2010 (2323 hospitals) and 2021 (51 hospitals) since they are incomplete 
                        and were missing about 60% of the hospitals. We are using data from 2011 to 2020 which report 
                        data for 6784 hospitals for a total of 61,061 rows and 104 columns. Our data includes 
                        administration cost information, personnel/staff, the total number of discharges, and bed records 
                        just to name a few. we are using data for the years 2011 to 2020 to calculate the efficiency of 
                        4800 hospitals ranging from 11 different types [Table 2]. We assumed that hospitals that provide 
                        the same type of service and are relatively similar in size (bed capacity, discharges, staff) should 
                        have approximately the same expenses for their day-to-day operation or administration. After a 
                        quick look at the data, we realized that there was a lot of variation in the administrative cost for 
                        the hospitals, which reinforce our decision of using administrative complexity as a domain of 
                        waste to evaluate the hospitals in our data. Further exploration of the data, we realized hospital 
                        Type 1 which refers to general short-term hospitals have the most variation when it comes to 
                        administrative complexity cost, hence we made hospital Type 1 our focus.</p>

                    <p>You can find a full disclosure of the list of variables in the variable section. We use 23 
                        variables [Table 1] for our input which is the summation of various administrative expense 
                        categories that range from simple building maintenance, equipment, laundry, cafeteria, acquiring 
                        organs, and patient record keeping, just to name a few. Hospitals usually deliver many services 
                        which can be seen in as many outputs as possible, fortunately, due to our data being reported at 
                        an annual header level, we can limit our output to the Number of Patients (Admission), Number 
                        of Beds, Number of Inpatient Discharges, Number of Outpatient Discharges. We can have 1 
                        input if we use the total administrative cost or up to 104 inputs if we use the different variables 
                        that make the total administrative cost separately. Overall, we have 23 inputs [Table 1] and 4 
                        outputs. All our variables are statistical variables
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>After validation and staging, we removed data from 2010 and 2021 and are left with 61,061 rows 
                        and 5520 columns for 6784 Hospitals. After isolating form 2552-10 WORKSHEET B-1, we are 
                        left with 104 columns. Hospital Type 1 is the one with the highest administrative cost [Figure 2], 
                        and the highest administrative cost variation [Figure 3]. We extract all the data with a hospital 
                        type 1, and with data reported for the full-time range of 2011 to 2020, we end with a final count 
                        of 46,749 rows for 5131 unique hospitals. We also further divided the hospitals of type 1 by 
                        using their Primary Specialty, and by using their number of specialties. This allows us to further 
                        group similar hospitals with one another. We want to leverage this grouping to better understand 
                        our output. As hospitals with more complex specialties or with multiple specialties may spend a 
                        bit more on their administration, while simple specialties may spend less. 
                        Hospitals Specialty grouping 
                        <ul>
                        <li> 1 - 2 Specialties (low Complexity) </li>
                        <li> 3 - 5 Specialties (Moderate Complexity)</li>
                        <li> 6+ Specialties (High Complexity)</li></ul></p>

                    <h3>Data Envelopment Analysis </h3>

                    <p>We will use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) 
                        to calculate the efficiency score of the hospitals. A little background about DEA and SFA, 
                        usually the methods are used in the financial sector, nonetheless, many researchers have used 
                        them to determine hospital efficiency scores in the past [8]. They typically identify the hospital 
                        sector of operation, then calculate the efficiency associated with the healthcare units. DEA is a 
                        non-parametric method that uses math programming for efficiency calculations and estimates the 
                        efficiency of a non-parametric measurement from the uncertain frontier [70].
                    </p>

                    <p>For DEA we will use Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) which implies that output will 
                        change by the same proportion as inputs. Hence the name is constant. We will also use Variable 
                        Returns to Scale (VRS) which imply that an increase or decrease in input or outputs will not 
                        result in a proportional change in the outputs or inputs. Using those two methods will make our 
                        Data Envelopment Analysis efficiency score more reliable. Figure 4 shows a visual 
                        representation of CRS and VRS for decision-making units, in our case hospitals. With CRS the 
                        increase or decrease in scale for the inputs or outputs results in the same proportional change on 
                        the opposite side which can be the outputs or inputs respectively. In other words, the scaling of 
                        the inputs and outputs is constant. While the scaling for VRS falls under a set of possible values
                        instead of being constant. In other words, an increase in inputs doesn't always increase outputs 
                        and vice versa [Figure 4]. This allows us to truly test hospitals and determines their optimal and 
                        ideal efficiency scores.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Stochastic Frontier Analysis</h3>
                    <p>SFA is a parametric method that hypothesizes a practical form of the model in which we 
                        can use data to evaluate the decision-making units (DMUs). SFA requires the input variable to be 
                        the total costs which means that the cost efficiency is evaluated. The output should be tied to the 
                        patient’s health status. Unfortunately, the patient's health status is not easily measured and is 
                        replaced by alternative variables that represent the same result in almost all the hospital's 
                        efficiency studies. Such variables are Inpatient and outpatient discharges, admission, and bed 
                        capacity. The original formulation of the SFA model is based on the stochastic frontier 
                        production function and it can be implicitly expressed in matrix form as follow:
                    </p>

                    <p>Oi = Iiβ + εi , ∀i = 1, . . . , n (1)</p>
                    
                    <p>where Ii and Oi are, respectively, the input and output vector of the i th DMU (i = 1, . . . , 
                        n), β is the vector of unknown parameters to be assessed, and εi is the composite error term. The 
                        error term is specified as the difference εi = Vi + Ui . The vector Vi is defined by random effect 
                        variables that account for the aggregate effects of unobserved factors on the production process. 
                        These factors are exogenous and cannot be controlled by the DMUs. The vector Ui consists of 
                        non-negative random variables and is introduced to account for technical inefficiency in 
                        production. This inefficiency is commonly expressed in terms of output deviations from the 
                        frontier due to factors that can be controlled by the DMUs. 
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p> According to Katharaki [8], both DEA and SFA approaches provide different efficiency 
                        estimates for numerous criteria such as statistical inputs and outputs definition, data availability, 
                        and noise. Nonetheless, Katharaki [8] figured out how to combine the methods to measure 
                        efficiency properly. To combine both methods, we leverage an average technical efficiency 
                        (ATE) model made up of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis 
                        (SFA) for assessing efficiency in public hospitals during the year 2011 to 2020. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        The DEA method is a non-parametric method that requires no information other than the 
                        input and output quantities. SFA is a parametric method that considers stochastic noise in data 
                        and allows statistical testing of hypotheses about production structure and degree of inefficiency. 
                        We use these two competing approaches to balance each method's strengths, and weaknesses and 
                        get the best possible results.

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Results And Discussion</h2>

                    <p>The Hospital Efficiency using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), is assessed first. We 
                        used the 23 administrative costs variables as input and total inpatient outpatient visits/discharges,
                        and bed capacity as output. The number of DMUs is equal to the number of rows of our data 
                        matrix (we first run with a sample of 1000 hospitals), N= 1000. The number of input variables, S 
                        = 23. The number of output variables, M = 4.
                    </p>

                    <p> We ran the CRS, VRS, SE models and compared the results [Figure 7]. Constant returns
                        to-scale (CRS) reflects the fact that output will change by the same proportion as inputs are 
                        changed. For example, if the input is doubled, the output will double as well. Variable returns to 
                        scale (VRS) is a type of frontier scale used in data envelopment analysis (DEA). It helps to 
                        estimate efficiencies whether an increase or decrease in input or outputs does not result in a 
                        proportional change in the outputs or inputs respectively.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The input-oriented approach considers a hospital to be technically efficient if the hospital 
                        can reduce its inputs (total administrative cost) while still delivering the same outcome or more
                        (inpatient outpatient discharges, admission, bed capacity). Comparing the results of our CRS, 
                        VRS, SE we can see that our VRS results are on average better than our CRS. We can also see 
                        that 95% of our hospitals can be optimized to meet their ideal SE. That optimization is quite 
                        difficult as the optimization for one hospital will not necessarily produce the same positive effect 
                        on the entire hospital system.
                    </p>

                    <p> Looking at our results with our provider specialty complexity grouping. We realized that 
                        our high complexity group which is hospitals with 6 to more specialties, and our moderate 
                        complexity group which is hospitals with 3 to 5 specialties are doing worst than our low 
                        complexity hospitals which have 1 to 2 specialties. While the percentage of efficient hospitals is 
                        low in all groups[Figure 9], we can see that the low complexity group has a better ratio compared 
                        to the other groups. Our explanation is based on how complex certain services provided by a 
                        hospital can be, and how those complex services, may require a higher input to be achieved. For 
                        example, a hospital that provides family medicine services should have a lower complexity 
                        compared to a hospital that provides surgery, rehabilitation, cancer, and cardiovascular services 
                        all at the same time. Those specialties require more equipment, requires more staff, and 
                        specifically more skilled staff. That increase in the input will not always be met with a 
                        proportional increase in outputs. Which in conclusion results in the hospital being overly 
                        inefficient.
                    </p>
                    <p> Looking at an annual efficiency trend, we can identify 2011, and 2012 as the years when 
                        the CMS hospitals were the most efficient [Figue 10]. We can also see a decrease in hospital
                        inefficiency in 2020 which we attribute to the direct effect of the covid 19 pandemic. During the 
                        pandemic, a lot of hospitals experience a high increase in utilization [Figure 11] in other words 
                        while their inputs were the same, the hospitals saw a big increase in their outputs which in most 
                        cases made those hospitals less inefficient since now their outputs matched their inputs. All the 
                        hospitals in our data set were affected by that fact, fortunately, since we used Sthocastic frontier 
                        Analysis, we were able to handle that effect in the data, while all hospitals experience an increase 
                        in efficiency score in 2020, SFA was able to prevent all of our hospitals in 2020 to be suddenly 
                        become efficient with an efficiency score of 1.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned earlier, calculating efficiency can be very difficult as there are so many 
                        external factors that have a direct impact on the score. The above figure [Figure 15] shows the 
                        effect of inflation on the efficiency score of our top-performing hospitals. From 2018 to 2019 
                        and 2020, the efficiency score of the hospital decreased by about 0.2 this is reflective of the 
                        increase in healthcare input cost due to inflation [Figure 16]. As the inflation, and labor shortage 
                        increased, hospitals spend more and more in certain areas while not being able to provide the 
                        same increase in output which result in the decline in efficiency that we saw.

                <div id="conclusion" class="blog-post">
                    <h2 class="blog-post-title">Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>In this paper, we analyze hospital waste related to administrative cost, more specifically 
                        administrative complexity which is one of the six domains of waste. By combining Data 
                        Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) model results, we were 
                        able to obtain the mean average efficiency score which is the best practice to obtain a more 
                        precise efficiency score. The results show that the average efficiency score of the nonparametric 
                        model DEA is the highest, unlike the parametric SFA model, DEA did not measure statistical 
                        noise. The combination of both DEA and SFA gave us a more balanced and reliable efficiency 
                        score. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It can be concluded that during the 10 years of 2011 to 2020, 95% of the hospitals in our 
                        Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data set were inefficient. The percentage of 
                        efficient hospitals is low in all of our provider specialty complexity groupings. The high 
                        complexity group which is hospitals with 6 to more specialties and the moderate complexity 
                        group which is hospitals with 3 to 5 specialties are doing worst than our low complexity 
                        hospitals which have 1 to 2 specialties. We investigate the annual efficiency trend and identify 
                        2011, and 2012 as the years when the CMS hospitals were the most efficient [Figue 10]. We also 
                        noticed a decrease in hospital inefficiency in 2020 which we attribute to a direct effect of the 
                        covid 19 pandemic. During the pandemic, a lot of hospitals experience a high increase in 
                        utilization while their inputs remain the same. Globally, during our 10 years period we saw a 
                        decline in efficiency, in average the CMS hospitals had an efficiency score below 0.7 in 2011 
                        and a decline below 0.6 by 2020. Comparing the top 5 efficient hospitals to the bottom 5, the less 
                        efficient hospitals have an efficiency score below 0.1 while the efficient hospitals have a score 
                        above 0.9. The gap in efficiency score (0.8) between the top 5 and bottom 5 shows there exists 
                        room for improvement for many of the hospitals in the CMS data. We investigated some of the 
                        external factors that may affect hospital efficiency some of which are inflation, and labor 
                        shortage increased. Hospitals spend more and more in a certain area while not being able to 
                        provide the same increase in output which can result in a decline in efficiency. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our big takeaway is that hospitals regularly benchmark themselves against other 
                        hospitals in their market and use that knowledge to adjust administrative design and structure to 
                        make themselves more efficient. Knowledge sharing can also make a big difference as inefficient 
                        hospitals should be able to implement some of the policies/guidelines that have made other 
                        hospitals very efficient.

                    <h4 class="blog-post-title">Limitations and Future Recommendations</h4>

                    <p>As future work, we couldn’t tackle the simulated reduction in Hospital administrative 
                        cost and evaluate to see the impact of such reduction on the hospital output (inpatient outpatient 
                        visit/discharges, bed utilization) and bottom-line profitability. We have used CRS, VRS for 
                        DEA, and SFA with and without time effect. There are other parametric methods such as the 
                        thick frontier approach (TFA) and deterministic frontier approach (DFA) and CCR-BCC in the 
                        DEA that can be considered. We can also use an extended dataset that includes private hospitals, 
                        teaching hospitals, and research hospitals for a more complete representation of the hospital 
                        market. We can also use more member or hospital visits related data to have a deeper 
                        understanding of readmission rate, length of stay, and quality of care. We know that certain 
                        specialties may warrant an increase in hospital input while not generating the matching outputs, 
                        we can also take a deeper look and try to identify those specialties so a hospital would have a 
                        better understanding of how a specific specialty may impact their efficiency metrics. We can 
                        investigate the correlation between profits and administrative efficiency so hospitals can see the 
                        economic benefits of being efficient. Lastly, we can take a deeper look to see if more efficient 
                        hospitals are better businesses.
